# JavaScript Simple SPA Router<br>(No Front End Framework Needed)

This code demo was to create a simple SPA (Single Page Application) Router with plain JavaScript using no front end framework.

I was inspired by the article located [here](https://medium.com/altcampus/implementing-simple-spa-routing-using-vanilla-javascript-53abe399bf3c) but wanted to take it a little further, adding dynamic menu event listening and a simple NodeJS/Express back end. At 1.7MB, this is a tremendous starting point, when you don't require the bulk of an enterprise-level front end framework.

## OTHER ENHANCED VERSIONS !!!:
- [SIMPLE SPA ROUTER - ES6 MODULES](https://github.com/nuntius-rex/simple-spa-router-es6.git)
- [ELITHICA SPA - ES6 MODULES + REST](https://github.com/nuntius-rex/elithica-spa)
